### To run
- Run in debug mode to see console outputs.
- You might have to name the parent directory of all these files `Test` but I'm not sure.
- You don't need to do the whole "new c# project" thing, I think it should just work as is
- Resize the window when it opens to get rid of the scroll bars (once I figure out how to set the window size from the code we won't have to worry about this)

### About the code
- **All you have to worry about is Form.cs and zzz.js**, you can ignore all other files for now.
- Form.cs is the C# side, and we can write all our javascript in zzz.js for now, there shouldn't be much to write though in fact what's in there now might even be enough
- (You can read through the js files if you want, but it's not necessary)
- p.s. vito.js has been transpiled so it's not very readable, let me know if you want the original readable js file

### Controls
- A, D to move left and right
- W or Space to jump
